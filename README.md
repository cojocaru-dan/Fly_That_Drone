# fly-that-drone

### In this project we act as if we work for a drone manufacturer company. We have to create a simulator for their products. The first series is ready, these are drones with ground movement capability. They have many more in the pipeline. Our task is to create a simulation engine to facilitate a virtual 3D showcase of the drones for the potential customers.

### The company wants fast development. The simulation engine needs to be flexible enough to handle new requirements regarding the movement capabilities of the drones without major developments to the engine itself. This ensures that the new drones can be included in the simulation as soon as they are developed by the company, with very little code change.

### What are we going to learn?
### •	Practice open-closed principle.
### •	Practice single responsibility principle.
